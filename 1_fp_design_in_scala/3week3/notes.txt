FP Design in Scala - week3
==========================

-------------------
Functions and State
-------------------

- An object has a state if its behavior is influenced by its history.

- In Scala, mutable state is constructed from variables:  
  var balance = 0

- Even if an object doesn't have internal vars, could still be stateful, for example, if that object uses another stateful object.



-------------------
Identity and Change
-------------------

- the substitution model ceases to be valid when we add the assignment operation

  - example:

    val x = new BankAccount   |---> different than:   val x = new BankAccount  
    val y = x                 |                       val y = new BankAccount

- this means the substitution model is not valid for all code that is NOT PURELY FUNCTIONAL (ie: has imperative constructs)

Loops

- variables are enough to model all imperative programs
